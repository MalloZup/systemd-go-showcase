# systemd golang

This is a minimal example. It is based on lib: https://github.com/coreos/go-systemd

I assume you run this in your $GOPATH and use install the `ginkgo` and `go-systemd` lib with `go get -u ...`

# BDD style

You can run the BDD `kubernetes` framework `ginkgo` with :

`cd ginkgo`
`go test` or simply `ginkgo`

# Minimal without bdd

on GOPATH `go build`. RUN!

Try other services.. :dog:
